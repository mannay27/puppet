Lab Exercise 1 
Resources -   
a)	File 

PuppetMaster

[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests

[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# vi site.pp

file { '/opt/gitrepo':
  ensure => directory,
  owner  => root,
  group  => root,
  mode   => "755",
}
Save the file by pressing Esc + :wq!

PuppetAgent

[root@ip-<AGENT IP> ec2-user]# puppet agent -t

Expected Result:-  The puppet should create a folder with name /opt/gitrep. The permission should be set as “drwxr-xr-x”  and owner should be root.

PuppetMaster  

Now modify the file site.pp to remove the directory we created.
[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# vi site.pp




file { '/opt/gitrepo':
  ensure => absent,
  owner  => root,
  force  => true,
  group  => root,
  mode   => "755",
}

PuppetAgent

Override the runInterval in Puppet Agent to query the catalog in 1 minute interval

[root@ip-<AGENT IP> ec2-user]# vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf
[main]
certname = agent1
server = puppetmaster
runinterval = 1m

 
b)	User

PuppetMaster  

Create a new user named ‘puppetuser’ using puppet manifest file 

[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# vi site.pp

user { 'puppetuser':
     ensure=>present,
     uid=> '507',
     shell=> '//bin//bash',
     home=>'//home//puppetuser',
     managehome=>true,
}
Save the file by pressing Esc + :wq!

PuppetAgent

[root@ip-<AGENT IP> ec2-user]# puppet agent -t

Expected Result:-  A new user will be created and a folder under /home with name puppetuser.

c)	Package
		
[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# vi site.pp
	
package {'curl':
    ensure => installed,
}
package { 'epel-release':
        ensure  => present,
}

package { 'nginx':
    ensure => installed,
}
d)	Service
	
package { 'epel-release':
        ensure  => present,
}
package { 'nginx':
    ensure => installed,
}
service { "nginx":
      ensure  => running,
}





e)	Exec

exec {'Run a command':
    command => '/bin/echo `/bin/date` >/tmp/output.txt',
}
	
f)	cronjob

PuppetMaster  

Create a new user named ‘puppetuser’ using puppet manifest file 

[root@ip-<MASTER IP> ec2-user]# vi node.pp

node default {
  file {'/tmp/testfile.txt':
    ensure => file,
    content => "hello world",
  }
}

PuppetAgent
