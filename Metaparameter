#Metaparameters 

Metaparameters are attributes that work with any resource type. With metaparameters, you can change how Puppet handles specific resources.


before:- This resource will be applied before the dependent resources.



notify:- This resource will be applied before the notified resources.If Puppet makes changes to this resource, it will cause all of the
notified resources to refresh.


require:- The required resources will be applied before this resource.



subscribe:- The subscribed resources will be applied before this resource. If Puppet makes changes to any of the subscribed resources, 
it will cause this resource to refresh. (Refresh behavior varies by resource type: services will restart, mounts will unmount and re-mount, etc. Not all types can refresh.)
