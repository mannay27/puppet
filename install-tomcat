# Create and Install Tomcat


We will create two classes.

1) Install tomcat and examples
   tomcat, tomcat-webapps 

2) Start and enable tomcat service


Tomcat Install class

Connect to puppet-master and create the  manifest files to install tomcat.

[root@puppet-master manifests]# cd  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/tomcat/manifests

1) Create the manifest file install.pp to install tomcat server

install.pp

class tomcat::install {
     package { ['tomcat','tomcat-webapps']:
         ensure => installed,
     }
}


2) Create service.pp to start the service

class tomcat::service {
  service { "tomcat":
      ensure => running,
      enable => true,
  }
}


We can now call the tomcat classes from the app.pp created earlier ( Check classes section )

Edit app.pp to include the call to invoke tomcat::install and tomcat::service.

node "puppet-agent1","puppet-agent2" {
    include java::install
    include tomcat::install
    include tomcat::service
}



Testing

SSH to agent machine (puppet-agent1)  and run "puppet agent -t".  Once puppet applied the catalog, you should be able to access 
the tomcat url.
