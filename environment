# Environments

A Puppet master serves each environment with its own main manifest and module path.
This lets you use different versions of the same modules for different groups of nodes, which is useful for testing
changes to your Puppet code before implementing them on production machines.

By default agents were configured to pull the cataglog from  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp. 
To run a test, you can copy the content below (modify the node name) to site.pp and run 'puppet agent --test'


node "ip-172-31-35-58.ap-south-1.compute.internal" {

        user { 'tim':
                ensure     => present,
                uid        => '601',
                shell      => '/bin/bash',
                home       => '/home/tim'
        }

        package { 'tree':
            ensure => installed,
        }
        package { ['wget','curl','git']:
           ensure => installed,
        }
        user { 'deployer':
                ensure => absent,
        }
}

If you want to change the environment, you may pass it as argument while running the test using --environment value

For Exp:-  puppet agent --environment=production --t


Configure puppet.conf file in Puppet Master to set the default environment

[main]
server = puppet.example.com
environment = production
confdir = /etc/puppetlabs/puppet


We could also configure the puppet.conf to choose the environment based on the environment passed from agent.

vi /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf in master node and append the below section. Based on the environment passed, it will pick
the right pp file.

[master]
manifest    = $confdir/environments/$environment/manifests/site.pp
modulepath  = $confdir/environments/$environment/modules
