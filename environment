By default agents were configured to pull the cataglog from  /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp. 
To run a test, you can copy the content below (modify the node name) to site.pp and run 'puppet agent --test'


node "ip-172-31-35-58.ap-south-1.compute.internal" {

        user { 'tim':
                ensure     => present,
                uid        => '601',
                shell      => '/bin/bash',
                home       => '/home/tim'
        }

        package { 'tree':
            ensure => installed,
        }
        package { ['wget','curl','git']:
           ensure => installed,
        }
        user { 'deployer':
                ensure => absent,
        }
}

If you want to change the environment, you may pass it as argument while running the test using --environment value

For Exp:-  puppet agent --environment=production --t
